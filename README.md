# Stock-Portfolio-Risk-Analyser
This project helps investors truly understand how risky their investments are — beyond just daily profits and losses. It calculates key risk metrics like Value at Risk (VaR), Sharpe Ratio, Beta, and asset correlations, runs Monte Carlo simulations to explore possible future outcomes, and presents everything in a simple, interactive dashboard.
